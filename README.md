# SupaBase Project Setup

This README provides instructions for setting up your Firebase project with Firebase Authentication.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (latest stable version)
- npm (Node package manager)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up Firebase Authentication for your project:

### 1. Install Dependencies
First, navigate to your project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Firebase Configuration
- Navigate to the `src` directory of your project:

```bash
cd src
```


- Next, create an `.env` file in the `src` directory and add the required environment variables. Ensure that you store sensitive data like API keys and credentials in this file.

### 3. Run the Application
Once the configuration is complete, run the `app.js` file to start the application:

```bash
node app.js
```

The app should now be running, and Firebase Authentication will be integrated.
